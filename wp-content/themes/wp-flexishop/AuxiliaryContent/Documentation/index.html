		<h3 id="installation"><strong>Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p class="notice">For detailed Wordpress installation instructions visit <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress</a></p>
		<p class="notice">For detailed WP E-commerce installation instructions or for more information visit <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce/installation/">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-e-commerce/installation/</a> </p>
		<p>For this theme to work correctly you will need to install the wp e-commerce plugin linked here. You can install and activate this plugin like any other Wordpress plugin, download the zip file, extract into the plugins directory, and install via the Wordpress admin area.</p>  
		
		<p>There are two parts to this theme, the basic Wordpress theme, and the Wp E-commerce theme. Make sure you install the wp-ecommerce plugin before going any further.</p>
		
		<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Download zip file.</li>
<li>Extract to computer</li>
<li>Upload folder "wp-content" to wordpress root directory, <strong>merge</strong> any changes.</li>
<li>Active wordpress theme under appearance->themes</li>
<li>Activate wp e-commerce theme under store->settings->presentation->theme</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have activated both themes you will need to change some of the page and media settings for optimal performance.</p>
		
		<p class="error">The theme uses timthumb.php to resize slider images. For this reason you should ensure there is a /cache/ folder located in wp-content/flexishop/ theme folder. This folder should have write-permissions, if you run into problems you can try and manually change the permissions to 777. The containing folder should also have permissions of 777. For more information visit the timthumb homepage at <a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/">http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/</a> </p>
		<hr>

		<h3 id="wordsettings"><strong>Wordpress Settings</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>You will need to change a few settings for the homepage and shop to display correctly. Follow the steps below and you will be adding content in no time.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Create a page called "Homepage" and set the page template (under page attributes) to Frontpage.<img src="assets/images/pagetemplate.png" alt="page template" /></li>
			
			<li>Create a page called "Latest News (or whatever you want your blog called)" and leave the page template as default</li>
			<li>Go to Settings -> Reading, and change the "Front page displays" setting to "A static page", set the front page to your homepage, and posts page to the blog page you just created.</li>
			<li>Once you install the WP E-commerce plugin you will notice it would of created a products page with 3 children pages. For the product page set the page template to "Store", for the checkout, transaction results, and your account pages, set the page template to "Checkout". </li>
			<li>Go to Settings -> Media and change the thumbnail size to Width:150 and Height:150, change the medium size to Max Width: 690 and Max Height: whatever you want. </li>
		</ol>  
		<p class="notice">You may find you will have trouble uploading larger files, in some cases this is due to a php memory limit and you will need to speak with your host. In other cases simply changing your "Large Size" in media settings to a large amount will fix the problem</p>

		<h3 id="ecomsettings"><strong>WP E-Commerce Settings</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>A lot of the wp e-commerce settings are optional, for example breadcrumbs and category images, however there are a few presentation settings you should change to make sure everything works hunky dory. </p>

		<h3 id="themelayouts"><strong>Theme Layouts</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>The theme has three different layouts for you to switch between. Each layout has the ability to change the background, fonts and content. </p>
		
		<h4>Simple Layout</h4>
		<p>The simple layout is elegant and sophisticated by default, yet though a basic background change and a few color swaps, you can change the entire look to suit your business and brand.</p>
		
		<h4>Full Layout</h4>
		<p>The full layout adds a changeable footer and header area to inject a bit of color into the design. You can even add a background image to the slider area for unlimited possibilities (e.g. a new background for each season).</p>
		
		<h4>Boxed Layout</h4>
		<p>The boxed layout is the safest choice when customising the theme. Add a background color or image, swap out fonts, for a completely different look.</p>

In fact, they can be used for pretty much anything! You have the option for the promotion to be linked to a product, a category or a custom link, its completely up to you!
