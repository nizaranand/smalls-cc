== Description ==

Front page login/logout and control panel with support for OpenID.

== Installation ==

Unzip and upload to /wp-content/plugins/ directory
Activate the plugin
Add the User Login widget to your sidebar
If your site doesn't support widgets simply add `<?php wpul_widget();?>` to your sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do, exactly? =

It builds a login form and control panel in the sidebar of your page.

= Do you need the OpenID plugin to use the WP-UserLogin plugin? =

Nope, it works all on it's own. But if you do have the [OpenID plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/openid/ "Add OpenID to your site") installed you'll have an OpenID field in your login form.

= Can I edit the CSS for the form and control panel? =

Yes, as of v5.0 a stylesheet editor has been included. If you don't like that stylesheet, or you have your own already, you also have the option to use your own stylesheet.
