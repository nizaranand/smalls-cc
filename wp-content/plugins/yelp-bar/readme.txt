A powerful bar that shows Yelp Rating & Reviews at the top of any WordPress theme, provides instant credibility.

== Description ==

Yelp has become indispensable for anyone that owns a business (regardless if you have a website or not). The Yelp Bar is a very easy & non-intrusive plug-in that shows the Yelp Ratings & Reviews for your business at the top of the page (same as HelloBar, doesn't stick). It provides your business with credibility, as visitors are quickly reassured through the rating & reviews provided by other users.

Demo:

* See it in action on our [Pubforce Theme](http://pubforce.happytables.com/).

Features:

* Works on any Theme without any customization.
* Provides your website with instant credibility.
* Conforms to strict Yelp display requirements.

Lightweight:

* Adds 2 queries when active.
* API is only called every 12 hours (unless settings page is accessed, in which case the data is refreshed).
* Settings & Transient API are used to store data.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I run this plugin on any theme? =

Yes, this sits at the top of a theme independently regardless of color or texture. The red border was also added in case of a white background. This helps give the bar its own individual look.

= Is it easy to setup? =

By all means, all you need to do is sign-up for a Yelp API key (from the link provided within the settings) and enter the phone number of your business.

= The Yelp Bar is activated but not showing up? =

Please make sure you've emptied your cache if you're using any sort of caching tool.

= Why aren't there any styling settings? =

Whilst you can always edit the plug-in code & related files, Yelp has a strict display code which this plugin abides by. Out of respect for these API conditions, I've not created any detailed customization settings.
